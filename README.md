# Song Randomizer Web App
I made this because sometimes I find it hard to find new music. I don't like relying on algorithms to feed me content, so I wrote this as a simple proof of concept of a communal playlist website.
Users can add and receive random songs added by other users. 

I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python/Django, and SQLite for the backend. For search functionality, I used the Youtube v3 API.
